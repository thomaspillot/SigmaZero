A level coursework project - Chess engine with integrated neural network

I have included the trained model parameters in the file 'model1.txt' (I encountered some issues trying to save it as a tensorflow save file...), so once you have cloned the repo - just run the main.py file (you may have to update some of the file paths first though).
